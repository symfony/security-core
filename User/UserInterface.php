 * Represents the interface that all user classes must implement.

 * This interface is useful because the authentication layer can deal with
 * the object through its lifecycle, using the object to get the hashed
 * password (for checking against a submitted password), assigning roles
 * and so on.
 *
 * Regardless of how your users are loaded or where they come from (a database,
 * configuration, web service, etc.), you will have a class that implements
 * this interface. Objects that implement this interface are created and
 * loaded by different objects that implement UserProviderInterface.
