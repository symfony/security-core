 * Represents a class that loads UserInterface objects from some source for the authentication system.
 *
 * In a typical authentication configuration, a user identifier (e.g. a
 * username or email address) credential enters the system (via form login, or
 * any method). The user provider that is configured with that authentication
 * method is asked to load the UserInterface object for the given identifier (via
 * loadUserByIdentifier) so that the rest of the process can continue.
 *
 * Internally, a user provider can load users from any source (databases,
 * configuration, web service). This is totally independent of how the authentication
 * information is submitted or what the UserInterface object looks like.
